Android Asset Export – Sign Language Recognition Model

This script exports model metadata required for Android inference.

Files generated:
1. classes.txt
   - A text file containing all gesture/gloss class names
   - One class per line
   - Used by the Android app to map model output indices to gloss labels

2. norm_mean.bin
   - Binary file (float32) containing the feature-wise mean
   - Flattened array used for input normalization
   - Must be applied before inference

3. norm_std.bin
   - Binary file (float32) containing the feature-wise standard deviation
   - Flattened array used for input normalization

Purpose:
These files ensure that Android inference uses the exact same
normalization statistics and label mapping as the Python training pipeline.

Usage in Android:
- Place all files inside the app’s assets folder
- Load classes.txt as a list of strings
- Load norm_mean.bin and norm_std.bin as FloatArray (Little Endian)
- Normalize input as: (input - mean) / std

Important:
- This export step is required only once per trained model
- Re-export is needed only if the model is retrained or classes change
